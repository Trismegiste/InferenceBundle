This fork is a beginning for a fresh start sooner or later.

Prolog has very limited use but it can simplify some problems with few lines.
For example, you can avoid big boring sequences of if-else-switch to implement
business intelligence with limited rules and predicates.

My goal is to validate, debug (if necessary) and port this js to php : goal achieved

TODO:
* remove all notice (lol)
* make a service-like class
* namespacing the classes
* refactor the model to be more PHP-like and not js-like (remove some weird object)
* using getters and setters
* create a builder to easily construct atom & term without parsing
* make a bundle for symfony2
